# Complete Setup Guide for Non-Developers

This guide will walk you through setting up your Basketball Stats Tracker from start to finish. No coding experience needed!

## What You'll Need

- A GitHub account (free)
- A Vercel account (free)
- A Supabase account (free)
- About 15-20 minutes

---

## Part 1: Set Up Supabase (Database) - 5 minutes

Supabase is where your basketball session data will be stored.

### Step 1: Create Supabase Account

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Click **"Start your project"**
3. Sign up with GitHub (easiest option)

### Step 2: Create a New Project

1. Once logged in, click **"New Project"**
2. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `basketball-stats` (or any name you like)
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password and **save it somewhere safe**
   - **Region**: Choose the one closest to you
3. Click **"Create new project"**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for the project to be created (it will show a loading screen)

### Step 3: Create the Database Table

1. Once your project is ready, click on **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar (looks like `</>`)
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Copy and paste this code into the editor:

```sql
-- Create sessions table
create table sessions (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  date date not null,
  players jsonb not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
alter table sessions enable row level security;

-- Create policy to allow anyone to read sessions
create policy "Allow public read access"
  on sessions
  for select
  to anon
  using (true);

-- Create policy to allow anyone to insert sessions
create policy "Allow public insert access"
  on sessions
  for insert
  to anon
  with check (true);
```

4. Click **"Run"** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
5. You should see "Success. No rows returned" - that's perfect!

### Step 4: Get Your Supabase Keys

1. Click on **"Settings"** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
2. Click **"API"** under Project Settings
3. You'll see two important values:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://abcdefghijk.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key (under "Project API keys" - it's a long string)
4. **Keep this tab open** - you'll need these values soon!

## Part 2: Upload Existing Data to Supabase - 2 minutes

Now let's add your existing basketball stats to the database.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

1. Go back to the **SQL Editor** in Supabase
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Copy and paste this code (this will add your 3 existing sessions):

```sql
insert into sessions (date, players)
values
  ('2025-01-15', '[
    {"name": "Mike Johnson", "gamesPlayed": 10, "gamesWon": 7, "notes": "Great shooting day"},
    {"name": "Sarah Chen", "gamesPlayed": 10, "gamesWon": 6, "notes": ""},
    {"name": "James Lee", "gamesPlayed": 10, "gamesWon": 8, "notes": "MVP of the day"},
    {"name": "Emma Davis", "gamesPlayed": 10, "gamesWon": 5, "notes": ""}
  ]'),
  ('2025-01-22', '[
    {"name": "Mike Johnson", "gamesPlayed": 12, "gamesWon": 8, "notes": ""},
    {"name": "Sarah Chen", "gamesPlayed": 12, "gamesWon": 9, "notes": "On fire today"},
    {"name": "James Lee", "gamesPlayed": 12, "gamesWon": 7, "notes": ""},
    {"name": "Alex Martinez", "gamesPlayed": 12, "gamesWon": 6, "notes": "First time playing"}
  ]'),
  ('2025-01-29', '[
    {"name": "Mike Johnson", "gamesPlayed": 8, "gamesWon": 6, "notes": ""},
    {"name": "James Lee", "gamesPlayed": 8, "gamesWon": 5, "notes": ""},
    {"name": "Emma Davis", "gamesPlayed": 8, "gamesWon": 4, "notes": ""},
    {"name": "Alex Martinez", "gamesPlayed": 8, "gamesWon": 5, "notes": "Improving!"}
  ]');
```

4. Click **"Run"**
5. You should see "Success. 3 rows returned"

## Part 3: Set Up GitHub - 3 minutes

GitHub is where your code will live.

### Step 1: Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click **"Sign up"**
3. Follow the prompts to create your free account

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. Once logged in, click the **"+"** icon in the top right
2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `basketball-stats-app`
   - **Description**: "Basketball stats tracker web app" (optional)
   - **Visibility**: Choose "Private" if you don't want others to see the code, or "Public" (both work fine)
4. **Do NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
5. Click **"Create repository"**
6. **Keep this page open** - you'll need the URL

### Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. Open **Terminal** (on Mac: press Cmd+Space, type "Terminal")
2. Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Work/claude-projects/basketball-stats-app
```

3. Copy the GitHub repository URL from the page you just created (looks like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/basketball-stats-app.git`)

4. Run these commands one at a time (replace YOUR_REPO_URL with your actual URL):

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

5. Refresh the GitHub page - you should see your code!

## Part 4: Deploy to Vercel - 5 minutes

Vercel will host your website for free.

2. Click to expand it
3. Add these THREE variables (one at a time):

   **Variable 1:**

   - Value: Your Supabase anon public key from earlier

   **Variable 3:**
   - Name: `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

4. Click **"Deploy"**

5. Wait 2-3 minutes for the deployment to complete (you'll see a progress screen)

6. When it's done, you'll see a **"Visit"** button - click it!

## Troubleshooting

### "Supabase not configured" warning

- Make sure you added all 3 environment variables in Vercel
- Variable names must be EXACT (including `VITE_` prefix)
- After adding variables, click **"Redeploy"** in Vercel dashboard

### Can't login to admin panel

- Double-check your `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in Vercel settings
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in the password

### Data not showing up

- Check the Supabase SQL Editor → click "Table Editor" → select "sessions" table
- Make sure the insert query ran successfully

### Need to change your admin password?

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click **"Settings"** → **"Environment Variables"**
3. Find `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
4. Click the three dots → **"Edit"**
5. Change the value
6. Go to **"Deployments"** tab and click **"Redeploy"**

## Updating Your App Later

If I (the developer) add new features to the app:

1. Pull the latest code:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Work/claude-projects/basketball-stats-app
git pull origin main
```

2. Push to your GitHub:
```bash
git push
```

3. Vercel automatically redeploys! No extra steps needed.
